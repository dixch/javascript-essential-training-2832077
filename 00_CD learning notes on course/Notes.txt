python -m http.server
Can also install an extension to launch code

Prettier and ES lint not working; Is it because Node is installed outside the project?

$ npm install prettier

Order: Always define constants and functions etc up the top, so you know the browser has read it before launching the next thing

//** tab for docs block

cmd + / on a highlighted line comments out the whole line
Repeat to take away the comments

Indents for hierachy.
Indent all the bits that go inside

script tag: Used to just drop into html but edge case

<script src="script.js"></script>
leads to render blocking

<script src="script.js" async></script>
Faster, downloads script while rendering then pause render to execute

<script src="script.js" defer></script>
document needs to complete, only execute js after full html parse

Always use async or defer as default. Loading js in footer is now an antipattern

<script type="module" src="script.js"></script>
If module then default is defer

When object is in a seperate script file, this takes it out of the context of the browser.
We can no longer access it directly through the browser
Leave in main file if you need to access it-
Use a class instead so you can reference it in the main code but reduce clutter

Prototype base object oriented language.
Each object is an instance of a Prototype
